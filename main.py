### About the Model
Our tool leverages the power of **Prophet**, a robust time series forecasting model developed by Facebook. Prophet is particularly effective for stock price predictions due to its ability to handle seasonal trends, irregular spikes, and long-term patterns in data. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: We take historical stock data from the CSV file you upload, which includes key features like Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Percent Change, and Volume.
2. **Model Training**: The Prophet model is trained using the past stock prices, particularly focusing on the **Close** prices to learn historical trends.
3. **Forecasting Future Prices**: The model forecasts stock prices for the upcoming 365 days based on the trends learned from the historical data.
4. **Recommendations**: Based on the forecasted prices, we suggest the best dates to sell your shares, considering a stepwise increase (e.g., 10, 20, 30 units, and so on).
5. **Data Filters**: We filter out the forecast data to recommend only dates that are beyond your purchase date and today, and where the predicted price exceeds the specified thresholds.
